***Strategic Code Monkey***


##  Summary

A multilingual front-end coder, I speak English, CSS, HTML, French, Drupal, all cleanly and semantically of course. Common sense usually prevails throughout, provided a good supply of tea.

Frontend United London 2013 co-organiser, a not-for-profit european conference delivering inspiring talks.

Working with Drupal for 5 years as a themer. I attended 8 Drupalcamps in 2012 and spoke at 3 about how to stop designing pages and effective on-boarding processes.

Likes: Open source, fruit, styleguides, agile and kanban, git, SASS, Drupal theming, pattern libraries, Github, nonprofits, collaboration, structure and tea.

Dislikes: static web page design PSDs, messy markup, multi-national corporations, projects without version control, without documentation, without project management, coffee, not being able to learn new things.
